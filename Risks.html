									<p>While creating the synthesizer there are a few physical risks involved. The synthesizer will be created using an Arduino uno this process involves the use of soldering irons, wiring, and coding the microcontroller board.  Throughout this process there are many underlying risks which are involved and may harm the safety of the individual who is tampering with the board and or coding it. During the development process of creating a synthesizer, common risks are, soldering risks, electrical shocks, software risks. The soldering iron will be used on the Arduino board to join electrical wires and C++ will be used to code the Synthesizer, and by doing so, there are risks associated with this.</p>
                                    <p>The soldering iron’s get extremely hot, and usually range around 200-500°C, if the tip of the soldering iron is touched, it will cause a burn on the individual’s finger or whichever part of their body was touched this would lead to them requiring immediate attention and cold water should be applied on the burn area for at least 5 to 15 minutes to ensure the burn is treated correctly. The burn should not be treated with any ointments and creams and it  should naturally heal after this, a small protective cotton cloth can be applied to ensure dirt and dust do not touch the burn. To avoid this risk, individuals should handle the soldering iron safely and appropriately and should not aim the iron at other people, with prior knowledge on how to use it, since if not used correctly, it could lead to burns.</p>
                                    <p>When soldering wires, the solder metal will closely be held to the iron, ensuring that there is at least a considerable gap (at least 4 inches) between the solder metal and the soldering iron, since when they are in contact the metal will fuse with what is in contact. If an individual’s fingers are too close to the edge of the solder and the soldering metal, the solder could splatter onto their fingers, hence causing a burn. To ensure this does not happen, make sure there is a 4-inch gap between the top of the soldering iron and where your fingers are placed on the solder</p>
                                    <p>Further when soldering wires should be held by clamps since when the solder will be applied onto the wire, it will heat up the wire and if someone is holding this wire using their hands it could lead to a burn, since they are holding a wire which is being heated.  This risk can be avoided by using pliers and clamps to hold the wire when soldering.</p>
                                    <p> When soldering fumes are created due to the contact of the solder and the iron, this is due to the heated rosin-based fluxes and can cause asthma and or irritate an individual’s eyes. To avoid this risk, people with asthmatic conditions should stay away from soldering or should use masks when soldering to ensure that no fumes enter their respiratory system. Eye irritation can be avoided by using safety glasses to guarantee that less fumes enter the individuals’ eyes.</p>
                                    <p>When the Arduino is connected to a PC using a USB connection there is a risk of a small electrical shock. This is due to the output voltage supplied to the Arduino. If the output voltage is greater than 5V DC it may output static electrical shocks to the individual using it. AC and DC would output electrical shocks if the voltage output is extremely high. To avoid this a safe voltage output should be used, to avoid electrical shocks.</p>
                                    <p>During the programming phase, Arduino will be coded in C++ or C#, since it allows for special parameters and methods which are unique in C++ which allow for reliable inputs and outputs. However, the risk imposed is that C++ will need to be learnt by the group members, while everyone is comfortable with python, C++ is extremely different to python it is more efficient due to its fast compiler. This means that C++ will need to be learnt in order for the synthesizer to be functional, in addition to these parameters and algorithms will need to be created for the synthesizer to work. Given the timeframe, this imposes a risk to the outcome of the project, since C++ is a completely new language which will need to be learnt by everyone.</p>
