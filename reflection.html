									<h2>Individual Reflection</h2>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h3>Aryan Verma</h3>
									<p>The communication of the group went swiftly, through using teams and discord we were able to communicate with each other efficiently and clearly, while also getting closer with each other and understanding each other as friends. This helped the group environment since we were not strangers with each other and were more like friends, all contributing to a group assignment. Further the content to the group work was proof-read by group members to ensure that the information was relevant to the rubric. Improvement could be pre-planning meetings to ensure that all members are able to come to meetings, pre planning the work during the first week of the assignment would also be efficient, so group members know which parts of the assignment they are doing. This will allow for more time to do the assignment especially when there is such a time specific assignment and will ensure for more time to edit the information when everyone is done with their content. The extension was surprising however, very helpful. Without the extension the work which we produced would not have as much depth and content as what we do now. Overall, the extension provided more time to complete the assignment to a higher standard.</p>

									<h3>Naveed Naleem</h3>
									<p>The group had very strong communications and stayed in touch about assignment work and updates very frequently. There were no issues of people not participating enough as everyone did their bit and did exceptionally well. All group members put all their hard work and highest possible effort into the work to create a desirable outcome. Things that could be improved are scheduling meetings 24hrs prior to the actual meeting, otherwise everything else is all good. One thing that was surprising was the result of our work and how we managed to organise parts properly and put them together to create a presentable assignment. One thing I have learnt about groups is that it’s easier to allocate parts to people and combine the work instead of doing one part at a time together. The GitHub log activity reflects the groups progress and what brought it to the final stages of completion. Overall, the group contributed for their part and had an equal share of work so it was a good collaboration and resulted in a well-made assignment filled with knowledgeable research and information. I think this group performed really well in terms of cooperation and the trust levels were very high and everyone was being truthful when it came to their progress.</p>

									<h3>Urvesh Parmar</h3>
									<p>Almost everything went according to plan. We probably could have started a bit earlier but other than that everything went smooth sailing. Our communication and everything was good as well, we communicated well through teams and help meetings as well. We communicated about what we had to do individually and messaged when we had completed our individual parts. Meetings were done with a minimum of 3-4 of us. One thing that surprised me was that we actually did decently even though we started quite late. The website as of now is almost done and the report we are working on now is almost done and looks pretty good, i went for a minimalistic approach. One thing I learnt about our group was that we have good cohesion and work well together. It was easy to work together as we are friends but at the same time we were not complacent just because we are working with our friends. Overall we had good synergy and worked well together. For the future it would be better if we went harder in the beginning and left the final week for final editing and touching up.</p>

									<h3>Hasham Baig</h3>
									<p>The group had constant feedback and communication between each other about the assigned work and having regular feedback from peers to double-check our work. Another thing that went well was everyone completed their section during the given time, which enabled us to be on top of our work. All team members put in effort when completing the work to the highest possible standard as well as finishing it on time. However, what needs to be improved next time will be scheduling the meeting at desired day and time where all team members are available to participate, otherwise, everything went according to plan. The one surprising thing would be that the amount of effort and quality that was put in by everyone to complete the assignment to a presentable standard, and time management was carefully planned out for the week. The one thing that I learned about the group was everyone was open and free to help each other out when someone is stuck on a particular section and constant feedback was present throughout the assignment. The given extension did help us manage our times better by spacing out the work throughout the weekend and weekday, however, if we were not given the extension, quality wouldn’t be our strong point. Overall, all team members completed their equally given work at a high standard.</p>

									<h3>Zuhayer Choudhury</h3>
									<p>In terms of what went well whilst working on the assignment, communication was a strong point for our group. All of us communicated with each other on a near daily basis on discord and teams and provided one another with updates towards the completion progress of the assignment. Participation was also very strong within the group as everyone completed their designated sections to the best of their abilities and no one really had to be chased up for not doing their work. In terms of improvements, our group could have improved in some areas as we felt they fell a bit short compared to others. One such area was scheduling group meetings; our group typically scheduled them last minute instead of scheduling them at least a day in advance, which also influenced our motivation to have a meeting at all. By sticking to a proper schedule, this could have improved overall team motivation and resulted in potentially more frequent meetings. One thing that surprised me was how efficiently the team was able to work with one another, despite the hiccups along the way. Something I learned about groups is that each group member has their own style of tackling their designated tasks and that there is no "right" way of doing something. The key thing is whether they have done what they needed to or not.</p>

									<h3>Matthew Jackson</h3>
									<p>Despite my best efforts the project work ended up being rather rushed at the last minute but, I’d consider this a growing pain and adjustment to the individuals of the group and learning the dynamic. I think the group genuinely has great potential for assignment 3 now that they’re more accustomed to working together. We had some trouble starting up initially and maintaining a
									steady workflow in the beginning but we rallied together and pushed out a product above our original expectations. I feel some level of responsibility for the initial laid back approach and I'm glad that we managed to turn it around despite a rougher star. While I may be wrong I believe that we have done a good job bringing our work together and making our collective work come together in a neat package.</p>

									<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
									<p>Throughout the assignment process it was agreed that the communication was key for the group. Throughout the extensive use of discord and teams group members were able to understand each other as friends and group members, we understood that work needed to be complete by certain dates and everyone attempted their hardest to complete their assigned parts by the given due date. The peer feedback was also a highlight throughout the project, on google docs we created a system in which peers could review work and verify it when proof-read, a highlight system was used to ensure that information was precise and accurate and was completed to the highest standard possible, and covered all points on the rubric. All in all everyone contributed equally and completed their given parts at the highest possible standard and informed group members on teams and discord their progress and how long it would take for them to complete. However there were also downsides to this group project, one key area was the time, since we started late there was a lot of stress people were under due to the timeframe. It was agreed through members that meetings could be planned 24 hours in advance to ensure that everyone would be able to attend the meeting, since it was shown through the meetings that some people could not attend meetings due to work and or other commitments. Furthermore planning and assigning given parts to people could have been done earlier to ensure that people were able to complete their parts before the set due date. This would have been very efficient for the group since members would be able to understand which parts they are doing, when it is due by and allows each person to research more about their given section. Something which was unexpected was the extension given by Anthony, this was crucial for our group since it gave us a reality check on where we should be, given that there was only about a week left. The report and website would have rushed, however the extension allowed for more depth and content to go into the report, and the website is cleaner and more simplistic, portraying the report in a format which stands out to the user. To conclude it was agreed that, time played a key factor in this assignment and to improve on this, time management should be planned out along with given parts of the assignment to ensure that work is complete.</p>
