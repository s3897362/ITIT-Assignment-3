									<h2>Opinion on Ideal Job</h2>
									<h3>Aryan Verma</h3>
									<p>Having looked at the burning glass data my opinion on being a systems administrator has not changed. If anything by looking at the data it has influenced me more into pursuing it. Systems administrator is ranked 8th on the Burning Glass data, showing that the job is highly in demand. This motivates me knowing that the job will be highly in demand once my course is complete. The burning glass data ensures to me that a systems administrator is a reliable job which will continue to grow in the upcoming years, furthermore increasing the demand of system administrators.</p>
									<h3>Naveed Naleem</h3>
									<p>I have looked at the burning glass data and according to its findings my ideal job has not changed. This is due to the fact that the pay for the job that I am currently deeming my ideal job, has a good pay and the burning glass data shows that the pay for my ideal job is high and that the job is in high demand.</p>
									<h3>Zuhayer Choudhury</h3>
									<p>After looking at the burning glass data, my opinion on being a senior programmer has somewhat changed. This is because it was not ranked on the top IT job title list at all which suggests that the profession is not in very high demand. The low demand may be due to it being a senior position and for the majority of graduates who want to enter the workforce straight away,they will not be looking for senior positions in the games industry as they lack the required experience. Hence the low demand from potential employees.</p>
									<h3>Hasham Baig</h3>
									<p>After reviewing the burning glass data, my opinion has also shifted on the left side on being a Cyber Security Analyst, mainly because it wasnâ€™t even listed on the job title data and also similar roles of the profession are not very demanding currently. Thus, being low demand and lack of recognition of the role has changed my views about the job as a Cyber Security Analyst.</p>
									<h3>Urvesh Parmar</h3>
									<p>After looking at the burning class data for March 2018, my opinion on being a software developer hasn't changed much. The data states that there were 337 Jobs, this means that it isn't in top demand but there aren't any jobs for it. I still want to be a Software Developer but it means I might have to work harder and stand out more as there aren't many jobs available.</p>
									<h3>Matthew jackson</h3>
									<p>After looking over the burning glass data my opinions on my ideal job have remained quite similar; despite how much I love music and the aspects of the process that make it possible, an IT job that I have the relevant skills for would be a much better option in terms of financial security which is what I originally thought before viewing this data. The jobs are skilled but also highly paid and in demand which is an attractive career opportunity.</p>
