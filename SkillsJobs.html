									<h2>Arduino</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>Due to the recent rise in popularity Arduino is a rising microcontroller due to its accessibility and ease of use, an Arduino is an advanced microcontroller. A microcontroller is essentially a small computer, which has a circuit board with many components, which can contain many CPU (central-processing-units) and built-in memory which allows for a programmable input and output using languages such as python, C++, and C#. This circuit board can allow resistors, structures and transistors which intervene between components in the circuit to the ground, which is the reference point in an electrical circuit where voltage is commonly measured and or calculated <sup><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vcc-and-vss-pins#:~:text=VCC%20(Voltage%20Common%20Collector)%20is,Supply)%20means%20ground%20or%20zero." target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>. Inputs of the Arduino can consist of Motion sensors and GPS receivers and are more compatible with the Arduino. Through these, there is a respective output for example, an LCD output which displays text.</p>
									<p>Arduinos are extremely flexible and can be used in many real-life applications, such as synthesisers, game controllers and even refrigerators. Arduinos are easily accessible and easy to use, they are extremely cheap meaning people who are new to IT can experiment with the various functions of them. The study of Arduinos began in 2005 in Italy and was further created by an Italian company ‘SMART PROJECTS’ in late 2008. While Arduino is not the latest and greatest technology out, Arduinos are extremely flexible, they are cheap and reliable, and they can be used for many purposes, an understanding in electronics and programming will allow a developer to create reliable projects such as synthesisers and controllers. While they are not the ‘latest’ technology out, the Arduinos dependability makes them the greatest microcontrollers out. In the future Arduino allows for easy prototyping, since they are efficient and effective through how cheap, reliable, and easy to use they are. This allows for prototyping to be much cheaper, and for smaller businesses this means they can benefit largely from it, a cheap prototype which will lead to better and more functional products which is highly effective and efficient for small business, these cheap prototypes can also lead to easier upgrades, interface and functionality can easily be changed if a developer is using an Arduino board, furthermore, increasing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of a project. However, in the future Arduino is also allowing developing countries to utilise the full potential of these microcontrollers.</p>
									<p>Due to the cheapness and reliability, Arduino will allow for medical and manufacturing industries to thrive, this will help developing countries, develop and utilise the full potentials of technology in all branches especially medical. Arduinos can be used to measure heart rate and pulse oximeters <sup><a href="https://www.skillsroad.com.au/blog/life-hacks-blog/a-day-in-the-life-of/may-2020/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-it-support-specialist#.YIdxv7Uzbb0" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> (SP02). For this to happen, a buzzer, MAX30102 and an OLED display are needed. The MAX30102 is a heart rate and pulse oximetry sensor, the combination of this and the buzzer allow for an accurate measurement of heart rate. The buzzer syncs with the individual's heart rate and the beats per minute for the individual is shown on the OLED display. This would be essential for developing countries who cannot afford expensive heart-rate sensors, instead these Arduino heart rate sensors can achieve the same function of a high-end heart rate sensor and can identify symptoms of cardiovascular, diabetes or high cholesterol. The technological development of a MAX30102 (heart rate and pulse oximetry sensor), allows a heart rate sensor to be made.</p>
									<h3>Impact</h3>
									<p>This will benefit people in third world countries since they have reliable technology for medical purposes, a heart rate sensor is not all an Arduino can do, ultrasonic lights, Alzheimer’s assistants and automatic hand sanitizers can be made using an Arduino. This is extremely beneficial, and production of medical tools made from Arduino will help individuals in developing countries, especially in the times of COVID-19, an automatic hand sanitizer will be essential for stores, and public places. This will lead to individuals getting more involved in technology since they have more resources made from Arduino to help them if they have any medical problems. This will help doctors, hospitals and the people of the country, doctors and hospitals will use these heart rate and pulse oximetry sensors daily to diagnose the symptoms of an individual. By understanding that an individual’s heart rate is high, doctors from the country can make quicker decisions to help the patient and give them the correct diagnosis.</p>
									<p>Further Arduino in the medical field, is extremely efficient for doctors and hospitals and even patients, they will be using the technology which is designed to be user friendly, to understand their symptoms and their diagnosis. This may replace existing old technology in the developing countries which is outdated and may give inaccurate results, new technology made with Arduinos will also be cheaper, meaning it will be more accessible for doctors and patients. This technology will not replace jobs, however, make the doctors and hospitals work easier, since the medical Arduinos are efficient, due to the cheapness and reliability of them. However, they also need to be coded by a programmer to be functional, although it is convenient for the developer, for example a heart rate sensor is made in bulk, the code for it can be copied over.</p>
									<h3>How will it affect you?</h3>
									<p>This will also affect me positively, if I am ever visiting the doctors or a hospital Arduinos may be used to create a heart rate sensor, to understand my symptoms if I am ever feeling unwell. This is extremely beneficial for everyone, in all countries since Arduino can make more medical technologies available to most, if not all medical related stores, such as the doctors or the hospitals. In the future when Arduinos are used more commonly in the medical field, I will be reassured, understanding that an Arduino board is used to create the tool I will be reassured understanding that my results will be accurate and precise. While things may not be different, my understanding of Arduino will be different, I will further be assured by the reliability of it when used in medical fields. Since I have family and friends in the medical field, they may use Arduino for different tools to help the patient, with my further understanding of Arduino I could help them when developing the tool. Although it will also benefit them, due to the convenience made with the tools, for example the heart rate sensor will provide accurate and precise results, and should be easy to use for the doctor, the results are easily shown on the OLED display further adding to the convenience of the project. I have family in third world countries too, hence these medical Arduinos will help them if they are unable to acquire high end equipment, and will also lead to convenience for the doctors living in these third world countries.</p>

									<h2>Robots</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>The use of machinery as tools has sparked in the 21st century, for the convenience of humans around the world. Robots are essentially machinery which help humans do tasks and operations that humans cannot do or cannot do to a satisfactory extent. The use of Robots is extremely flexible and can be used in many fields of work and even everyday life. Robots can help humans with everyday tasks and even tasks we find difficult to complete, robots are programmed through algorithms and parameters to ensure that the tasks humans find difficult can be complete, to the highest standard. Robots can also aid humans’ complete tasks which may be risky, for example there are cow herding robots which protect the farmers when they are dealing with over 100 cows. These robots ensure that the farmers are safe and makes the cow herding process much easier and more convenient. While robots are not the ‘latest’ they have rising potential to be the ‘greatest’ technology out since there have been many technological advancements in the 21st century with robots. Robots are extremely high-end and rely on advanced teams of programmers to code and identify parameters, without violating any ‘robo-ethics’, which is essentially the ethics around robots. Robots are used in many practical situations, they can be used at farms for cow herding to ensure workers are not hurt, robots are used in transport, for example the self-driving robot which ensures that the passengers are able to reach their destination safely and efficiently. Robots are also used in defence forces such as armies, robots can be used to safely defuse bombs without risking a human’s life, this is extremely beneficial for humans since lives are not in danger and robots are programmed accurately to defuse bombs. It is predicted that the use of robots will be more frequent in the upcoming years, robots may be used in more work fields such as education, security and at home, respectively. In education robots are said to be used in classrooms where robots could adjust their ‘personality’ in accordance with each student and will allow students to learn at their own speed. In the security field robots could potentially be used as drones, these drones will record suspicious activity and could act like cameras for a house and or public building. The frequency of cleaning robots may be used more in everyday life, robot vacuum cleaners may become more frequent with the public.</p>
									<p>The emergence of Artificial Intelligence allows for this to happen, and robots will end up being used more frequently in factories, robots are precise, accurate and are able to complete tasks efficiently. The convenience of automation makes robots functional and required. By automating tasks which take a lot of workforce, workers are less stressed out and machines can easily complete these tasks. For example, automating engine building allows for functional engines since they are not subject to human random error principle. Using robots to assemble engines, further reinforces the principle of automation, since they can assemble at high speeds while completing the task to a satisfactory standard.</p>
									<h3>Impact</h3>
									<p>The impact of automation will be convenient for humans. People will not need to spend long amounts of time on a task which can be completed by a robot in instants, this will further lead to the demand of robots, since humans always tend to appreciate tools which are convenient. The principle of Automation will impact everyone, and everyone will be fond of new robots which are convenient. Factories will instead use robots to assemble items, or use automated guided vehicles to move items, since it puts workers at less of a risk of injury and further is more efficient.</p>
									<p>However, this will impact people who work in factories and or industries, since their jobs will most likely be replaced by robots since they are more efficient than using human labour, robots will be able to follow a complex path without failure meaning they can do the tasks, workers do equally as, if not more efficiently. Robots are said to replace more than “20 million factory jobs” which will lead workers working in other fields such as transport, however transport is also vulnerable to automation due to autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, this will lead many workers, unemployed since robots are more productive and efficient than humans since they are precise, concise, and rarely make mistakes. They can produce more items and complete more tasks in a shorter span of time, working at a constant speed.</p>
									<h3>How will it affect you?</h3>
									<p>This will be more convenient for me; automation will allow me to use robots at home to do chores which I would take a considerable amount of time on. Robots are extremely dependable meaning, I trust the robot to complete tasks quickly and accurately. While I can spend my time doing other chores, or relaxing. Robots such as vacuums will help me and other individuals save time, and use that time for other tasks, such as schoolwork or work. Automation will be extremely convenient for my family members, spending time vacuuming can be replaced with a robot vacuum, spending time mowing the lawn can be replaced with a robotic lawn and spending time mopping can be replaced by a robot mop. Most household chores will be replaced by robots in the future, this will further reinforce how convenience and automation is needed in everyday life for humans to be effective and efficient. By spending less time on household chores, we can spend more time working, socialising with friends and family, and relaxing.</p>
									<p>I can see myself using robots such as self-driving cars to get me to my desired destination on time since they are efficient, I will not have to undergo the stress of driving and I can rely on a robot to drive for me. However, while the replacement of factory workers with robots will not affect me, it will affect people around the world and leave them unemployed since their jobs have been replaced by a more productive and efficient robot.</p>

									<h2>Crypto and blockchain</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>Blockchain is the tool and beginning of major cryptocurrencies of today. Blockchain is a method of storing data in a way where data are input into blocks and are chained to their predecessor once the data capacity for a block has been filled. Blockchain is used by many large corporations in data storage and their databases to store their data. However, blockchain is also used in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, although it is used in an altered way where the blockchains are decentralized meaning all data that is entered is irreversible. This means that transactions made with bitcoin are permanently recorded and can be viewed by the public interest.</p>
									<p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital asset based on a network of computers that perform calculations through peer-to-peer connections around the world. Cryptocurrencies are not widely accepted as they are known to be developed free from government oversight and influence as well as the markets being monitored by peer-to-peer internet connections. The transaction process of blockchain includes when a new transaction is made and transmitted to a network formed by peer-to-peer connections across the world. Then the network of these connected computers performs advanced calculations to solve equations that confirm the validity of a transaction. Once this transaction is confirmed it is combined with other transactions into blocks. The blocks are chained to their predecessors and the transaction is complete.</p>
									<p>This type of technology can be used to produce newly made currencies that rise above regular currencies and resources. It is a digital wallet where people can use to purchase products and services just like a regular currency. Cryptocurrencies are currencies driven by the people, it grows through demand and investments allowing it to exceed the value of current physical currencies that are used in countries such as the dollar ($), GBP or even the Kuwaiti dinar. For example, Bitcoin has currently exceeded $70,000 (AUD) which is well over any other currency in the world. Although it does not mean that the currency is exactly the strongest as the dollar (USD) circulates more than bitcoin making it a more popular currency and therefore deeming it the stronger currency.</p>
									<p>As of now, in the current time of writing this assignment, cryptocurrencies have grown to fluctuate frequently above regular currencies of multiple countries. There are over 1500 different cryptocurrencies available online and for the public to invest/purchase. Cryptocurrencies have also developed new forms of blockchain, such as Ethereum which is an open source blockchain which enables the use of Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications to be built and operated without any interference from a third-party distributor. Therefore, making it much more reliable when compared to other cryptocurrencies.</p>
									<p>In 3 years, cryptocurrencies may be inflated and rise above the regular currencies of today while retaining a strong currency through circulation across the world. Cryptocurrencies can soon become more common and widely accepted as regular payments made online although this may take more than 3 years due to its very minor popularity right now. Cryptocurrencies in 3 years can also open new areas of blockchain where new technologies are harvested through the data storage technique such as Ethereum which currently has Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications.</p>
									<p>Other technological developments that help cryptocurrency rise in popularity and demand may include apps that allow for the cryptocurrencies to be bought online easily throughout multiple countries. These apps have allowed people from over the world to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and help in the growth of the cryptocurrency sector. The apps also allow for easy transactions through the use of regularly used payment methods which helps increase cryptocurrencies popularity and accessibility. Other technological developments that increase the growth of cryptocurrencies are cryptocurrency mining machines. With newer technology and faster computer components mining cryptocurrencies is almost effortless and earns many shares in little time. Mining uses computer hardware to calculate equations fast and allows the miner to receive the currency as a reward for ‘lending’ their system. Cryptocurrency mining allows the currency to increase in price and value while also maintaining its reliability.New emerging cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin are driven by memes and popularity. It is however, no joke and has made multiple millionaires over the past few months of 2021. This gives hope to the cryptocurrency sector and the influence people have over how powerful these currencies can become. DTM.</p>
									<h3>Impact</h3>
									<p>Potential impacts of the development of blockchain and cryptocurrencies can include the introduction of a new currency being used commonly across the world. This can impact other currencies and cause some to become redundant and unused. Another impact that cryptocurrencies may have on the world is the environmental impacts such as carbon emissions through the use of crypto mining machines and computers which use power that is not renewable.</p>
									<p>The people who would be most affected by cryptocurrencies are those that cannot obtain such currencies due to the lack of resources, in turn they may be left out of future developments and opportunities. Other people who would be affected would include the governments of each country as they do not have control over the currency and are transparent to the general public. This would however allow individuals to take control over their money, rather than relying on an already untrustworthy government.</p>
									<p>Cryptocurrency technology would most likely create jobs such as mentors who assist others in the investments of cryptocurrency, businesses that run cryptocurrency trading would require employees for desk jobs and would create an increase in new demand for jobs. As for redundant jobs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain would most likely not create any redundant jobs as the emergence of this technology would not put any other jobs out of use instead it would create jobs.</p>
									<h3>How will it affect you?</h3>
									<p>In my daily life this would affect me as it would influence me to purchase cryptocurrencies as it is seen as the future currency. I believe that cryptocurrencies would take over most currencies of today and would become the primary payment method for most people. I think that it would fluctuate and increase in value giving many people and myself an opportunity to earn passive income and create a point where we can start our careers without financial disadvantages. Something that would be different for me with the emergence of cryptocurrency would be my dependency on it. I would eventually become dependent on the investments I have currently made to contribute to supporting my future as cryptocurrency has a high chance of increasing within a few years of time.</p>
									<p>This would impact my family by being a fast-moving technology and would possibly not allow them to keep up to date with the technology and completely miss big opportunities of making a large fortune or making their daily lives much more efficient. Cryptocurrency would impact my friends in a way where they would be influenced to invest and learn more about it which would be advantageous to them and can help them start their move towards earning profit or making transactions for products and services easier.</p>

									<h2>Clouds, services, servers</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>The cloud refers to the network of servers that provide users with computing resources such as software and databases. These cloud servers are accessed by the users via an internet connection. Cloud servers are located around the world and run by multiple companies such as Google. These servers allow many businesses to have a server for databases and /or software without the need for a physical server system in their business place. These cloud servers support many services that we use on a daily basis, such as Instagram which does not require a backup of posts created by the user instead all of that information is stored on their server and is accessible by the user via an internet connection and login credentials.</p>
									<p>This technology has state of the art accessibility and usability as it allows users to access the exact same data from multiple devices via an internet connection while not storing or installing anything on their personal machine. It is a new technology that has revolutionised the way we use our daily devices and files all being accessed through a cloud server. Another factor that has allowed cloud to become state of the art technology is its readiness to take over more complex systems and procedures such as the conversion of physical servers into cloud servers which gives many businesses the flexibility to take advantage of the extra space and reduce expenses on a marginal level depending on how expensive the technology that is going to take over is.</p>
									<p>With cloud computing and its technologies now, businesses can avoid the need for extra expenses going towards maintaining and operating their own servers. The expenses that would be reduced are IT costs and the needs of running the technology 24/7. The cloud currently has multiple uses where most involve the storage of data and backing up important data on the cloud. Some companies have taken advantage of cloud technologies and have created accessible cloud machines where a user can use the machine for their own personal use. This gives the advantage of using much more powerful hardware that not every individual has access to or that the user may only want a one time use of the powerful hardware. In the near future of 3 years cloud computing may take a big leap and become the primary source of computing. Physical computers may not be as efficient and reliable as cloud computers where the only requirement is to have an internet connection and other obvious requirements such as a screen to display information. In 3 years most businesses would have moved from physical servers to cloud storages where they can reduce costs and space required for their backups and storage of data. The future can hold an increase into business expenses as well. With the growing demand for cloud services the management and costs of these cloud services may impact businesses in terms of monetary confinements. Therefore, cloud services may only be used by leading businesses in their industry.</p>
									<p>Other technological advancements that allow the use of cloud services include the advancements of technology and computer components. This may include a newer and faster CPU (central processing unit) which can allow for faster processing while using the cloud services. Another technology that allows the use of cloud services are the improved internet connections, with the not so recent emergence of fibre optic cables which allow high speed internet connections, cloud services are able to transmit and receive data at fast speeds which allows users to have a seamless experience with the service.</p>
									<h3>Impact</h3>
									<p>The potential impacts of this development would include the reduced demand for physical servers in both businesses and personal use cases. This demand would be reduced by the implementation of using cloud services as data storage servers. This would reduce costs for businesses and save physical space otherwise saved for servers. A negative impact of this development would be the inability to access the information stored on the server without an internet connection which would otherwise be possible on a physical server. Another issue would arise in the form of deliberate threats to the cloud service company which can cause multiple types of data at large volumes to be lost, damaged or stolen.</p>
									<p> Another impact would be the change in the gaming industry as many large companies are competing to create a service which is run by the cloud, to allow users to play their video games via the cloud service using just a basic device. This enables the users to have access to high powered machines without physically having to own or use it. A disadvantage of this that is well known is the high input latency involved with using a cloud machine. Input Latency is the time taken for a computer to recognise an action performed by a device that is connected externally to the computer. This includes the keyboard, mouse and mic. The issue with high input latency for gaming is that it would possibly deter a user’s ability to avoid ‘lag’ as an excuse for dying. In reality, high input latency would handicap a user’s skills in a fast-paced or competitive game. This technology would create jobs such as those that are required to maintain and upgrade the cloud services and servers. However, those that run physical servers in businesses could be made redundant due to the growing popularity of cloud computing in businesses.</p>
									<h3>How will it affect you?</h3>
									<p>This would affect my daily life as I would be using more cloud services to complete my daily tasks and university works. These services can include google drive, google docs, one drive or even social media apps. Cloud services would dominate in terms of ease of use and accessibility as I can edit and read the exact same data from any device that has an internet connection. Things that may be different for me with this technology is my job preferences and ideal job. My ideal job is in the field of cloud computing and changes to this technology may change the types of jobs available and the pay of the jobs as well. This would also affect my family and friends as they would be using cloud services for their daily tasks as well. These daily tasks can include tasks such as creating a list or adding something to the google calendar. Cloud services would be used by most people as it can be accessed from multiple devices and has the freedom of mobility.</p>
