                                    <h2> Aryan Verma (Systems Administrator)</h2>
                                    <p>To be a qualified IT system administrator at TALENT, an individual requires experience in administering and managing an Information Technology Infrastructure Library environment (ITIL)and how to implement a ITIL process, extensive experience of Information Technology and software and hardware associated with it, extensive knowledge with Microsoft applications such as office365, MS Server and MS Active Directory. Finally, the individual requires solid knowledge on networking and understanding how computers share resources over digital interconnections.</p>
                                    <h2>Hasham Baig (Cyber Security Analyst)</h2>
                                    <p>The skills that are needed for a Cyber Security Analyst are mostly likely communication with the company as their comments and feedback is the foundation of your solution. Other skills include administration of information security systems, critical thinking, analysing company data and determining solution requirements. The qualifications that are required for this position is a degree in either information technology or computer science, other extra short courses of programming will further assist and overall help in general. The experience needed with high-level language will be around 5-10 years.</p>
                                    <h2> Urvesh Parmar (Software Developer)</h2>
                                    <p>This job involves developing client-based plugins and cloud-based 3D rendering services for clients including property developments, product launches, marketing applications and project management. What makes this appealing is that it involves 3D rendering, which I find interesting. These jobs also state that they are looking for ways to improve and enhance their processes for animation, 3D modelling and media production through software automation. Software automation is like my interest in AI in that it relates to making something else do something for us. The job also says that they have an office both in Melbourne and in Tokyo and I have always thought of having the option to travel overseas for work and Japan was one of those countries.</p>
                                    <h2> Naveed Naleem (Cloud Operations Engineer)</h2>
                                    <p>The skills that are required for a Cloud Operations Engineer include a wide variety of computer skills and technical solving skills. The role requires strong skills in linux, networking, scripting and web application servers. Other skills involve communication skills and cooperation skills as this job requires teamwork and wide communication with many work peers. This role is heavily reliant on problem solving skills and the ability to be responsible for actions taken to keep the systems running.</p>
                                    <h2>Matthw Jackson (Musician) </h2>
                                    <p>My ideal job would be to become a musician/artist. That being said, there really isn’t an advertisement for this job, all employment; comes from scouting and subsequent recording contracts or deals to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately recording contracts aren’t published in the public domain so I don’t have any historical examples to provide so I can only reference other musicians and their experiences.</p>
                                    <h2>Zuhayer Choudhury (Senior Programmer)</h2>
                                    <p>To be considered for this job, I would require at least 6-7 years’ experience working with the UNITY game engine and have developed at least 1-2 major IOS/Android applications. It also requires potential applicants to possess the ability to be organised with their work and be able to multitask, whilst working towards their priorities. Furthermore, this position requires applicants to be creative, focused, motivated and have a passion for making video games.</p>

                                    <h2>Similarities and Differences</h2>
                                    <p>Some common elements with everyone's job is that they are mostly in the IT field. They have some sort of computing and involve a wide variety of computer skills. Most jobs from each team member requires some experience in the IT industry and also requires experience with IT systems and computers.</p>
                                    <p> Elements that differentiates each position are level of qualification and experience which are different to each role. And certain roles have different IT specific skills.Some members are in the IT managing industry whereas others are in the programming industry or security industry.As well as others being in completely different areas other than IT such as music. </p>
                                    <p>Each job is also different in a way that they are unique in each section of the IT industry. The career plans however are all different, everyone has a different plan to achieve their ideal job and they all are aiming for different industries and not always specifically in the IT industry.</p>
