										<h3>Personal Information:</h3>
										<h5>Aryan Verma</h5>
										<article>
											I was born and raised in Melbourne with an Indian background and completed year 12 at Keilor
											Downs College. I am extremely passionate about playing volleyball and spend most of my
											pastime playing it, however I also do enjoy hanging out with my friends and playing video games,
											I enjoy fps and Minecraft. My interest in IT began in year 10 of high school, when we had to pick
											electives and I was inspired to pick an IT elective by my cousin due to the enjoyability and the
											vast number of fields in IT. I have coded websites before using brackets and I am comfortable
											using HTML and CSS. In my last year of high school, I picked up software development as a
											subject and throughout the year coded many projects however my biggest project was to create
											a lunch order system which used databases to store product and user information.

										<h5>Naveed Naleem</h5>
										<article>
											My name is Naveed, I am currently studying first year in the Bachelor Of Information Technology.
											My nationality is Sri Lankan and so is my culture, although I was born and raised in Australia. I live
											with my family which consists of me, my parents and my 2 sisters who are all very close to me. I
											recently got into a new hobby called ‘astrophotography’ and I enjoy spending my nights outside
											stargazing. I also enjoy gaming especially with friends whether it’s competitive or just for fun. My
											interest in IT started when I entered secondary, my love for computers came with gaming and
											learning about the parts needed to power a computer including the advanced programming and
											rendering needed to get games running.My ideal job would be in the areas of networking, cyber
											security, or cloud computing.

										<h5>Matthew Jackson</h5>
										<article>
											I was born in Australia, attended Northcote High School where I completed VCE, and I am now in
											my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I am regrettably only monolingual
											in English, but I am looking to start studying Chinese again. I’m currently blessed with a brown
											mid-sized Labradoodle named Huckle, as well as a pile of unpainted Warhammer miniatures that
											act as the skeleton in my closet.

										<h4> </h4>
										<h5>Urvesh Parmer</h5>
										<article>
											I am an 18-year-old Fiji-Indian, born in Lautoka, Fiji. I am currently a first year student studying for
											a Bachelor of Information Technology. I can speak and understand both Hindi and Gujarati,
											however, I cannot read or write in both. I graduated year 12 from Dandenong High School in
											2020 where nearly everything was online due to the spicy cough. I like to play video games and
											watch shows/movies or anime in my spare time. For whatever reason, not sure why, I used to
											roller skate when I was younger. I also participated in some competitions which included doing a
											routine where the judges would score you. My main interest in IT is AI and a little bit of
											cybersecurity and programming.My interest in IT I think started when I was younger, and I started
											to play video games I find AI the most interesting branch of IT as I am intrigued by how it works
											and also because AI is becoming more prevalent now and will continue to be in the future.Having
											also participated in the Vex Robotics Worlds Tournament in year 11, it got me more interested in
											AI/Robots and programming.

										<h5>Zuhayer Choudhury</h5>
										<article>
											What’s good, my name’s Zuhayer Choudhury and I am 18 years old. My family is originally from
											Bangladesh, but I was born in New Zealand, making me the odd one out. I have an older sister
											who I am very close with, despite the almost 12-year age gap. We speak both Bangla and English
											at home, but I predominantly speak English. For the past seven years, we have been living in
											Melbourne after moving from Gippsland at the end of 2012.
											I am a first-year student studying Bachelor of IT at RMIT University and so far, I’m really enjoying
											it. However, due to my predominantly science-based background from high school, IT is definitely
											a very different experience in terms of what I am familiar with.
											In terms of hobbies, I like to play video games on my Switch and my PC. I would consider myself
											to be a big Nintendo fan, ever since I got a WII for my 8th birthday. I would also consider myself an
											emulation enthusiast as it allows me to experience games on systems, I haven’t had the chance
											of owning myself or replay games on older systems I own, but no longer work. I also enjoy bike
											riding around my neighbourhood occasionally and going to the gym.

										<h5>Hasham Baig</h5>
										<article>
											I live in the south-east of Melbourne in Hampton Park. I am 18 years old, and I graduated from
											Hampton Park Secondary College, now I am currently attending university at RMIT on the city
											campus undertaking my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born in Australia
											(Vic) and my parents are from India. I have one older sibling who also attends RMIT on another
											campus. My hobbies include playing games, watching tv shows, listening to music, hanging out
											with mates, and driving cars. My interests in IT are about the security of sensitive data and
											information that is blocked and stored safely away from trolls and hackers who have the same
											motive to corrupt data or leak information to the public. The idea of creating firewalls and
											installing biometrics to avoid data being leaked or corrupted fascinates me.For me, the interest in
											IT started in high school when I chose software Development in year 11.

										<h3>Group Processes</h3>
										<article>
										For assignment 2 the group has worked efficiently in producing a
										completed report of our project idea and personal information. This report was completed within the allocated
										time and was submitted without any issues. Meetings have occurred weekly throughout the time span of the assignment.
										The team has cooperated tremendously and there have been no issues between the members. All members helped each other
										out and have provided full support towards the team's goals.
									</article>
									<article>
										Although for assignment 3 there will be some significant changes to be implemented. Such as organising tasks between members as soon as
										possible and using the experience we have gained from report writing in assignment 2, we will be attempting to complete assignment 3 well
										before the submission deadline. Most of the group skills would be implemented in assignment 3 as well such as cooperation and
										communication. The tasks would be delegated according to each member's  abilities and areas of expertise, which should in turn make the
										writing of the report much more efficient and effective. The team would also try to get every single member present for all meetings as
										this would allow everyone to clarify their questions and can allow the team to progress together without any members left behind on information.
									</article>
									<article>
										These improvements to our work flow during assignment 3 would hopefully allow us to finish earlier than the submission date and
										allow us to progress much faster while retaining maximum quality over the report and prototype.
