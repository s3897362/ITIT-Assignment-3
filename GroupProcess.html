                                    <p>For assignment 2 the group has worked efficiently in producing a completed report of our project idea and personal information. This report was completed within the allocated time and was submitted without any issues. Meetings have occurred weekly throughout the time span of the assignment. The team has cooperated tremendously and there have been no issues between the members. All members helped each other out and have provided full support towards the team's goals.</p>
                                    <p>Although for assignment 3 there will be some significant changes to be implemented. Such as organising tasks between members as soon as possible and using the experience we have gained from report writing in assignment 2, we will be attempting to complete assignment 3 well before the submission deadline. Most of the group skills would be implemented in assignment 3 as well such as cooperation and communication. The tasks would be delegated according to each member's  abilities and areas of expertise, which should in turn make the writing of the report much more efficient and effective. The team would also try to get every single member present for all meetings as this would allow everyone to clarify their questions and can allow the team to progress together without any members left behind on information.</p>
                                    <p>These improvements to our work flow during assignment 3 would hopefully allow us to finish earlier than the submission date and allow us to progress much faster while retaining maximum quality over the report and prototype.</p>
                                    <p>Our group will communicate online, through Microsoft Teams via both text and group voice calls. These Meetings will be recorded and be kept as a reference to fill out areas of planning and progress. Meetings will be planned to ensure that there is a topic to talk about for each meeting and to solidify that progress is being made. Meetings will consist of progress checks and updates from each group member to ensure that there is solid progress happening with their assigned area of the assignment. It is aimed to have at least two meetings per week, however there can always be more if needed, if there is more content and more progress being made more meetings should be scheduled to ensure that group members are not lost if they are finished with their part and can help with other areas. </p>
                                    <p> Outside of Microsoft Teams meetings there is a discord group which is used daily, to communicate with one another, this guarantees that there is a reliable and solid form of communication between all group members, where a single group member can address everyone if needed. If we have a group member who does not respond to communications, we will ensure to try to contact them on all social media platforms, if they do not respond it will be documented with screenshots of the texts and or emails and will be forwarded to the Tutor, Anthony Clapp. Past Experience has shown that communication is vital to the completion of the assignment, by talking with each other group members understand where everyone is at, and that there is progress being made by everyone, and if someone needs help with their part of their assignment, they can communicate during the Microsoft Teams meets and or by using discord to let others know that they require help. Microsoft Teams was also used to log any changes that took place towards the related assigned areas of work for each group member. These updates took place in the chat box of the Microsoft Teams chat. </p>
