									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Coding and constructing an Arduino based synthesiser with the functionality to create a uniquely one of a kind sound that no board shares, creating an almost DNA like effect that can be replicated between boards. Arduinos Uno’s are a microcontroller and are used all around the technology field due the accessibility and ease of access. An Arduino is essentially a small computer, which contains a CPU, RAM and external components which can be used for a synthesiser. A synthesiser will be used for a keyboard, which can create its own unique sound due to its functionality from an Arduino board. The Arduino will ideally be coded in python since many of the group members are accustomed to it and are comfortable with the efficiency and effectiveness of python. This synthesiser will be coded to create its unique sound through external components such as a GPS tracker which will create its own unique sound depending on the location of the synthesiser, this input of GPS location will ideally create an output which will produce external sound depending on the location. The Arduino would ideally have multiple sensors as well and these would possibly be modular. These sensors would include temperature sensors, daylight sensors, pressure sensors and multiple other sensors which can send different signals upon what is being sensed. This would in turn create different volume or pitch levels on the speaker and would create a different sound every time new information is detected. Also check out ‘https://s3897362.github.io/ITIT-Assignment-1/’ for the original idea of the project idea. </p>

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>The motivation for this project comes from an aforementioned interest in music and the desire to build gear. It would certainly be interesting as it encompasses many facets of Information Technology with both connecting hardware through digital and analogue means, as well as programming sounds and functionalities into the device. On top of this, it can be done many different ways. With cheaper Arduino and raspberry pi powered solutions being an easy way to implement this project being one of many ways of executing it; the concept has the flexibility to be more coding dependent than hardware, or to do the opposite. To devise and execute a methodology of having an arduino based synthesiser that sounds unique on any different arduino board, creating a rare and unique set of sounds that can’t be replicated on a low budget, this is to increase accessibility as well as creating a potential for a vast array of sounds to the average user. This goal is motivated by the need of innovating the music industry and involving new technologies to be used as instruments through different input types.</p>

									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>The goal for this Sythesiser is to create a sound-board that has the ability to create varying sounds according to the different input techniques. These different input techniques involve multiple sensors such as temperature, pressure, light and many more sensors that would be compatible with the Arduino board that we can get access to. Once all the components are gathered the project build would begin and it would be done with a modular system where the sensor components would be interchangeable. The synthesiser would need a case fabricated, bare PCB is a bad look as well as dangerous in general for the PCB and the user. The ideal method of input would be for a keyboard style input common among synthesisers with a possibility of drum pads or switches for additional effects; this is what’s known as the controller of the synthesiser. There are additional effects that need to be implemented and modifiable in the final product. They include octave adjustments; envelopes, which controls the attack decay sustain and release of the synthesizer; attack which is the initial part of a note which then lowers down through the decay section; if the note is held it enters into sustain and once it is let go release happens. These components are really important. Another very important component to a synthesiser is a voltage-controlled oscillator, which is what produces the wave, making it the source of the sound for the synthesiser. You pair this with the envelope generator and voltage-controlled filters to help shape the sound. This is all fed into a voltage-controlled amplifier before reaching the onboard amplifier. In short, the oscillator makes the noise, the filter shapes it, the envelope changes how it interacts with the piano keys. The voltage-controlled amp acts as a preamp for the onboard amp. The term voltage control has been mentioned a couple of times and it simply means the sound is adjustable at any point that is voltage controlled which allows for great variability in sound. The board can then be used to create unique sounds for music on a low budget and would be devised to create a much more budget friendly music industry.</p>
                  <h3>All the previously listed components allow us to produce the following features:
                  </h3>
                  <ul>
                      <li>A set of keys to control the synthesiser.</li>
											<li>Different shaped sound waves from an oscillator.</li>
											<li>ustomisation of Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release.</li>
											<li>Ability to move up and down octaves.</li>
											<li>A case to house the synth.</li>
											<li>Filters to change and shape the oscillators wave.</li>
											<li>The amplifiers to make some noise.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>All these components are the bare necessities for a simple synthesiser, but there are a few desirable features such as MIDI support, allowing for use as a MIDI controller with a Digital Audio Workstation. Loop functionality would also be a good feature alongside an arpeggiator function. Additionally to facilitate the functionality of a DNA like individuality between boards may require some algorithms to convert a MAC address into a waveform, this unique sound will be created through pitches using a GPS like tracker which will essentially tell the Arduino Board where the location of the board is, through this it will pick up different wavelengths and output a unique sound depending on the location of the Arduino board. This GPS tracker which connected through soldering and cables to the Arduino’s CPU and will let the CPU know where the location of the board is, this will furthermore create its own sound. </p>

									<h2>Arudino                                    </h2>
									<p>For our synthesiser project, we will be using an Arduino Uno. The software used to program the Arduino is either the Arduino Web IDE or the Arduino Desktop IDE. The IDE is where we would write our code before uploading it to the Arduino itself. Then to actually program the Arduino itself we would need to plug in the Arduino via a USB cable into a laptop or PC. The actual Arduino code itself is written in C++. Along with that, there are special methods and functions. And the code you write in Arduino can be referred to as Sketches. Currently as a group we only know how to code in Python, HTML and JavaScript. To use the Arduino IDE properly we would need to be proficient in in C++, meaning we would need to learn the relevant C++ but not everything, this is because in the Arduino IDE there are things known as libraries which provide basic functionality and done need to be coded fully. This would most likely be done online over w3schools, another website or YouTube videos. Once we feel proficient enough to code in C++ we can begin to code our Arduino to do what we want it to. We will then constantly code the arduino and test it until it has worked successfully and that it can complete the task we code it to.</p>
