									<h2>Individual Reflection</h2>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h3>Aryan Verma</h3>
									<p>I believe we worked well as a team this time. Compared to A2 where things were a bit messy and unorganised, this felt more structured since communication and meetings were scheduled more often. The team's meetings were short and precise, meaning that in a short amount of time we were able to cover the things talked about in the meeting. This could be since group members already had vague ideas of thoughts and observations to talk about during the meeting. The progression of work was just as good however, group members accurately filled in the timeframe once they had completed something when doing the report or when developing the Arduino, however this progression depicted to everyone that everyone is working efficiently to get the group work done. Something which could have been improved and was surprising would be the resources, if we gathered the GPS module we could have completed the original idea instead of making changes. However this change was needed and was quickly made to ensure that the development of the synthesizer could progress quickly. This allowed for the prototype to be made quickly, and the final product being made. One thing I learnt was that through efficient meetings and communication, group work can be efficiently completed.</p>

									<h3>Naveed Naleem</h3>
									<p>During the work time in assignment 3, we completed most sections within a reasonable time allowing us to have extra time to polish and complete more important sections outside of the report writing. Compared to assignment 2, everything was much more efficient and errors were avoided by a large margin compared to assignment 2. This was due to us starting early and completing tasks as soon as possible as well as allocating time for meetings and having everyone present most of the time. The meetings were also a lot shorter which allowed us to cover most things quicker and get us to work as soon as possible. The meetings were less confusing and more productive, meaning that we had less time discussing doubts and more time discussing future progressions and solving issues that arose. Something that could have been improved would have been the proper planning of our prototype which could have saved us a lot of time while we were thinking of solutions to overcome certain issues. One thing that was surprising would have been the quick cooperation of our team and the flawless communication that has taken place during the entire time span of assignment 3. Something that I have learnt about our group was that when we want to get work done it's as easy as that, we would be quick to complete work and avoid most distractions during the time of focus and seriousness. The github logs reflect all our website changes and show our progress of getting all the information from the google doc into the website within a few days. It shows quick progress as all the content has been completed and just needs to be transferred onto the website. </p>

									<h3>Hasham Baig</h3>
									<p>When completing assignment 3, we were able to finish most of the important sections in the sensible time given out status, which then gave us more time to work on the prototype and gather extra resources. Compared to assignment 2, our group was more aware of the due dates and mini milestones that were set to be completed in the report. The group became more organised and efficient when completing and delivering the work, also by scheduling a meeting time that was available for all group members, however, there were certain meetings where group members could not participate due to work or university times which was understandable. The meetings became shorter and quicker which allowed us more time to complete the report and prototype and within the meetings, discussions became more focused on the assignment rather than going off-topic which did not happen. Things that could be improved for this assignment is organising and planning the synthesiser prototype and gathering all the required resources needed to build the synthesiser. One thing that surprised me is how well all group members were actively engaging in all meetings and were cooperating. One thing I learnt was that everyone participated and helped in any way to finish the assignment.</p>

									<h3>Zuhayer Choudhury</h3>
									<p>During Assignment 3, our group was able to work far more effectively together and individually than we did during the completion of Assignment 2. Group members completed their allocated sections far more quickly, which allowed for more time to proof-read them and make changes accordingly. We were able to schedule and plan out meetings much more efficiently, allowing them to be concise in length and providing more time for us to complete our required work. Additionally, there was less confusion amongst group members during meetings which enabled for more time to look into possible future progress towards the assignment and for less time wasted solving major issues that could have hindered our progress. One possible improvement would be better planning in terms of the prototype, as our group felt like it was slightly rushed as we did not gather the required materials and resources quickly enough to allow adequate time to build the prototype without rushing. One thing that surprised me was how well we were able to work on Assignment 3 together and managed to meet our group set deadlines majority of the time. One thing I learned during the assignment was that if everyone does their work in a timely manner, tasks get done much quicker and reduces overall stress levels among the group members.</p>

									<h3>Matthew Jackson</h3>
                                    <p>This assignment went very well, we were coordinated ready on time and showed more of our potential that I spoke of in our previous assignment. I'm happy with what weâ€™ve done but as per usual slightly worried about the quality of some of my work but that will remain to be seen. One regret I have is not starting on prototyping earlier as I believe it would have streamlined some of the process. There's a big difference in the workflow from assignment 2 to assignment 3 but the roles remained similar solidifying my thoughts on the teams familiarity with each other increasing as well as workflow</p>

                                    <h3>Urvesh Parmar</h3>
									<p>During assignment 3, I reckon we did pretty good. We finished earlier than what we did in assignment 2. We started all of our work early on and completed almost everything before the deadline, compared to the last assignment where we submitted 2 minutes before the deadline. We communicated well and effectively like last assignment. We had regular and almost daily meetings together where we discussed what we have done and what we need to do. Our time management was better this time as we did well in terms of doing the work on time. Both the report and website look absolutely amazing and clean. The only thing we could improve on was our resources. If we had better resources we could have made a better synthesiser and had more features and sensors, other than that everything went swimmingly. A thing that surprised me was how well we worked and when we finished, which was earlier than better. We actually started earlier and consistently finished the content. I learnt that I procrastinate alot and leave things to the last minute, but luckily I have a good group which reminds me to do the work and do better. Overall we all did well and all helped complete this assignment to the highest standard we could achieve. </p>

									<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
									<p> Throughout the assignment period the group has cooperated well and has completed all required sections in the time that was assigned. All group members have contributed equally and have attended most of the meetings. The meetings were organised to provide every member the chance to join and contribute or clarify any details. Another thing that went well was that the group had finished all components required for the final report which gave us time to work on the prototype and work on the issues that were faced during the planning and testing processes. With some quick thinking we quickly pivoted to alternative solutions to the problems we encountered and restructured some areas of our project but overall gave our project greater feasibility.</p>

                                    <p>What could have been improved would be to have more resources readily available and organised code which had been implemented to work with our project idea to its exact form so that we could complete the prototype which would have allowed us to complete the prototype without any issues smoothly. Other than that most things were moving smoothly and everything was fine until the very end. We overall show adaptability and problem solving that allowed for changes throughout the project.</p>

                                    <p>One thing that was surprising was everyone managed to finish their assigned sections in a timely manner and each group member was actively engaging in the meetings, thus clearing all the doubt. Another thing that was surprising was the level of effort that was put in to complete the sections at university level.</p>

                                    <p>What we have learnt while working as a group was that we work very well while working on the assignment. Another thing we learnt was that if there was work to be done it would be done through determination to complete the assignment at a high level of complexion. Something else we have learnt was that the Arduino UNO uses a priority unique code which is based of C#. This has caused us to undergo a phase to learn the code and create a basic example of it through our prototype. </p>

                                    <p>The github log of activity presents the progress of the website development and also shows how we have edited the assignment 2 website to be compatible with the assignment 3 specifications. It also shows how we have moved all the content from the draft report to the website.Finally the github logs show the final stages of our project where we convert the information collected into a website and where we create a good presentation in the form of a website.</p>
