									<h2>Plan</h2>
									<p>For the project idea, we chose to look at a synthesiser built using an Arduino uno as one of our group members, Matt, already had an Arduino board and a good majority of the components necessary to build a functioning prototype. The synthesiser will use various components such as resistors, jumper cables, buttons, knobs and a speaker to create a circuit which will output a unique sound depending on the intensity of light in the location or the temperature in the given area. We also collectively decided to incorporate a variety of features during the planning process which included a GPS tracker, temperature sensors, daylight sensors, pressure sensors and more, some of these components will be used to create unique sounds which will change given the location, temperature, intensity of light or even the given pressure applied to the sensor. This was decided as we wanted to add a distinct and unique user experience, whilst also allowing it to stand out from potential competitors.</p>
									<p>Currently we are developing a prototype which will focus on creating a unique sound given the temperature of the location and the intensity of light applied onto the sensor. The prototype uses an Arduino Uno with jumper cables, knobs, and buttons to create a circuit which aims to output a sound to the speaker. The prototype will be functional, while the code and hardware will be extremely basic it will focus on the output of sound since this is the key function for the synthesizer. Code for the Arduino may be unorganized however it will aim to be functional, and changes to the code can be made during the final development phase and overall testing of the synthesizer. The prototype will help the synthesizer since it will portray changes which need to be made and the areas which need improving, changes may be for code or even the hardware used. The hardware resources can be upgraded so a more efficient connection is made between the circuit, and code can be refined to ensure that all statements are efficient and output the final sound from the speaker. The outcome aims for an Arduino Uno with a button which toggle the arpeggiator to turn off and on, then a knob will change between different notes and depending on the temperature and intensity of light applied onto the daylight sensor the synthesizer will output a unique sound from the speaker. In order for this to occur, the code used must be relevant and efficient, creating a connection between components on the Arduino Uno.</p>

                                    <h2>Progress</h2>
                                    <p >For Assignment 1, we had to write up our own individual profiles/reports and then learn and  use HTML and CSS to code a website and host it on GitHub Pages. This included information about our family, where we grew up, where we are currently studying and some of our hobbies and interests. We also had to include information about what we find interesting about IT/what draws us to IT, why we chose to study at RMIT and what we hope to learn or gain during our time at uni. Most of our team members we’re drawn to technology and IT through the love of software and hardware. Coming from multiple different backgrounds and personal hobbies the team members have experience in all different types of areas which as a result helps in working as a team and progressing through assignments.</p>
                                    <p> Additionally for A1, we had to talk about our ideal jobs and provide a summary of what the job entails, what skills and qualities are required as well as skills and qualities we currently possess (in relation to the job requirements) and how we aim to acquire the skills that are needed. Assignment 1 also required us to compile a personal profile by completing three different tests; a Myers Briggs Type Indicator test and two other tests of our choice. The personal profile was completed by gathering and analysing the results from the online tests we had completed. Every individual team member had a unique ideal job which we’re all related to the IT industry in a way. Some had IT implementations whereas others had management positions in the IT industry. </p>
                                    <p>Finally, the report required a detailed write up about an IT project idea that interested us and needed to include an overview of the project, motivation behind our project idea, description of the project, tools and technologies that are potentially needed, required skills and the outcome if the project is successful. Each IT project idea was carefully thought of and was in some ways unique and had no similar appearances in the real world but they were mostly realistic. Some projects were adaptations of already created projects/ideas which would help those existing ideas become more efficient and effective. Most skills required for the team members were general skills required in most jobs such as communication skills and cooperation skills. These skills seemed to be essential for almost any job and some team members have already acquired similar skills</p>
                                    <p>Assignment 2 required us to work together as a group to choose a project idea (from A1) to further elaborate on. We had to write up a report detailing various aspects of the IT industry and provide a detailed overview of what our chosen group project was. As assignment 2 was group based, the group needed to also schedule and record meetings using Microsoft Teams and have meaningful discussions regarding our progress towards the completion of the assignment. Additionally, we also had to design a website and host it on GitHub pages and set up a GitHub repository to store crucial files for our group website as well as ensure they were all in one central place. The project idea was chosen carefully with full consideration of whether it was currently possible to create a prototype in the timeframe given and given our current resources or resources we were able to obtain. The recordings on microsoft teams were scheduled every week and would be recorded. Each week would consist of updates on the team's progress for the assignment report and the work that needs to be done in the near future. The meetings would also clarify any doubts that team members had and answer any questions that weren't answered in the previous meeting due to insufficient information.</p>
                                    <p>The project began with a discussion of everyone’s ideas and what sounded the most unique and interesting to the group. The synthesizer attracted our attention since many of us had not heard of a synthesizer, this sounded like a unique and interesting idea to the group which led to further research about the functions of a synthesizer and how it can be unique to other synthesizers already on the market. The idea of a GPS module, temperature sensor or daylight sensor was presented elaborating on the idea that the sound of the synthesizer can change given the location and or temperature of the area. This progressed to a paper prototype which portrayed what the synthesizer will look like and the functions of each component on the board and how it will interact with the code when applied. The paper prototype overall aims to portray that the synthesizer will have a button which will toggle the arpeggiator, the knob will be turned to set different keys and depending on the temperature and intensity of light in the location the speaker will output a distinct sound. The purpose of the paper prototype acts as a foundation in the development process and aims to help the usability and functionality of the actual prototype. This paper prototype would be proposed as a project layout and would set the base for us to start preparing for the actual prototype.</p>
                                    <p>This led to the current stage of prototyping on the Arduino Uno and a breadboard, the aim of this is to create a basic synthesizer which can change sound given the intensity of light and temperature of the room.  In this stage of prototyping, we are creating a circuit which can output a sound, given the code which aims to interact with each component on the board. The prototype will act as a core to the foundation which we already have and will aim to help the development of the final product, since we already will have the resources needed to create the synthesizer.</p>
                                    <p>Currently, The prototype has been changed. THis is due to the photoresistor and the temperature sensor using too much Voltage. Since we do not have the resources available to provide the intense amount of Voltage to the temperature sensor a change was needed to be made. This change was that instead of using a photoresistor and a temperature sensor the Arduino Uno’s unique serial number will be used to produce these unique sounds. The board's serial number is A413936393135161F1C2, this is easier to create an oscillating sound, since the knob acts as a variable which can change the frequency of the sound. Code has been sketched up for this prototype and an output of sound is given through the speakers when the code is executed. This change was necessary for the development of the synthesiser, and allows for the synthesiser to be more functional. While it has become more basic and easier to understand, with the resources currently available this achieves the project scope efficiently. </p>
                                    <p>In the near future, the final product of the synthesizer will be complete and will aim to be completely functional. It will create distinct sounds using the Arduino Uno’s unique serial number. The code will allow for a connection between components to ensure that the speaker is able to output a unique sound. Once developed, there will be tests conducted on the Arduino to ensure that there are no bugs and errors hiding in the code. Once complete, it will end with documentation which will be report writing and creating the website, which we will present our information on.</p>
                                    <p>There were a number of dead-ends during this product, with many being resource and time based. A GPS module was not available meaning a change needed to be made. With the resources available we could create unique sounds using a temperature sensor and a daylight sensor so we decided as a team that it would be best if either one if not both of these components to create unique sounds. Since we did not have a key-bed we decided to make a two button arpeggiator which creates sounds using two buttons, this change was made since we did not have the resources and or money for a whole key-bed. Another dead-end was that we stated we would use python for the coding of the synthesizer, however Arduino supports C Sharp (C#), a completely new language which we did not learn, meaning we would need to learn C# in order to create connections between the Arduino using new algorithms and code. Further changing to C# acts as a small drawback since we would need to understand how to create algorithms using C#. However, this change is more efficient since C# is an extremely efficient language due to its speed and accuracy. Another dead end was the temperature sensor and daylight sensor. Since the temperature sensor and daylight sensor used voltage to measure temp and light intensity meant that a synthesizer and a temperature and daylight sensor could not run at the same time due to these conflicts. Meaning a change was required for the temperature and daylight sensor, this led to the idea of using the Arduino Uno board’s serial number to create unique sounds.</p>
                                    <p>However, if there was more time, money, and resources we could invest in a key-bed and GPS modules and have more time to spend learning C#. This would have allowed for a Synthesizer with more keys with different unique sounds depending on the key pressed, instead of a two button arpeggiator. If we had a GPS module available, we could have continued with the original idea instead of changing it to a temperature and daylight sensor based synthesizer. With more time, we could have further learnt key fundamentals to C# and how to efficiently create algorithms which would suit the Arduino.</p>
                                    <p>However, we kept running into issues when trying to upload files to the github repo (specifically "cannot publish, unborn head") and subsequently had to set up the repo three times. This was inefficient for the team since it meant that more time needed to be spent creating the repo again. Although this problem was fixed in the end, the core of the problem was detected and was made sure not to make the same mistake again.  We also had issues in terms of planning meetings as we would often schedule them last minute and hence could not always get all the group members to attend the meetings at the same time. This was inefficient since group members would need to watch the recordings after and if they had any questions during the recording they would have to message an attending member asking them questions and explaining the meeting, which would act as a minor inconvenience and issue. More specifically, time was an issue since group members took more time than expected to complete their allocated sections for the assignment which subsequently pushed everything back.</p>
                                    <p>If this project were to be handed over to a new team, providing them with a general overview of the project would be beneficial for them and a good starting point. This overview would include information such as what the project is about, how the device functions and what its primary purpose is, as well as the resources required. A blueprint can also be provided to depict how the Synthesizer will be designed and how each individual component interacts with one  another and how they function.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, the team would require an understanding of the main components that were used to build the synthesiser. This could be achieved by providing them a list of the components used and including a brief description of how they function in the context of a synthesiser.  The risks associated with these resources would also be needed to ensure the safety of individuals, hence a list of risks should be given to the future team.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, the team would also require an understanding of the underlying code behind the synthesiser, which is C#. They would need to familiarise themselves with the Arduino IDE and have some knowledge as well as experience with using C# so that they could potentially recreate/clone the project quickly and efficiently if necessary. By having a deeper understanding of the Arduino IDE and C# individuals can change code if necessary, ie. if there are more efficient algorithms and functions they can take advantage of.</p>
